`Active speaker detection is an important component in
video analysis algorithms for applications such as speaker
diarization, video re-targeting for meetings, speech enhancement, and human-robot interaction. The absence
of a large, carefully labeled audio-visual dataset for this
task has constrained algorithm evaluations with respect
to data diversity, environments, and accuracy. This has
made comparisons and improvements difficult. In this paper, we present the AVA Active Speaker detection dataset
(AVA-ActiveSpeaker) that will be released publicly to facilitate algorithm development and enable comparisons. The
dataset contains temporally labeled face tracks in video,
where each face instance is labeled as speaking or not,
and whether the speech is audible. This dataset contains
about 3.65 million human labeled frames or about 38.5
hours of face tracks, and the corresponding audio. We also
present a new audio-visual approach for active speaker detection, and analyze its performance, demonstrating both its
strength and the contributions of the dataset.
